# Student Management and Discussion Forum

This repository contains two separate projects: a Student Database Management System built with Django and a Discussion Forum created using PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome. Each project has its own set of features and technologies, and they are contained within the same repository for convenience.

## Student Database Management System (Django)

The Student Database Management System is a web application built with Django, a Python web framework. It provides functionalities for adding, editing, and removing student records. The system assumes that usernames and passwords will only contain alphabets or numbers. Please note that this application is designed for desktop usage.

### Usage

To run the Student Database Management System, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Django installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the following command:
   ```shell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.

## Discussion Forum (PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, Font Awesome)

The Discussion Forum is a three-page web application that includes a login page, a posts page, and a comments page. It utilizes PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome for functionality and styling. Please note that an internet connection is required to use the Bootstrap and Font Awesome resources.

### Usage

To test the Discussion Forum, you can use XAMPP, which provides a local server environment for running PHP applications.

1. Install XAMPP on your system.
2. Start the Apache and MySQL services.
3. Copy the repository files into the appropriate folder in your XAMPP directory (e.g., `htdocs`).
4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost/<path-to-repo-folder>/` to access the Discussion Forum.
